In the preceding section we sketched trajectories for some particular linear systems. They were chosen to illustrate the different possible geometric pictures. Based on that experience, we can now describe how to sketch the general system.
$$\boldsymbol{x'}=A\boldsymbol{x}, A= 2\times 2 \text{ constant matrix.}$$
The geometric picture is largely determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$, so there are several cases.  
For the first group of cases, we suppose the eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are *real* and *distinct*.  
**Case 1.** The $\lambda_i$ have opposite signs: $\lambda_1 > 0, \lambda_2 < 0$; **unstable saddle.**  
Suppose the corresponding eigenvectors are $\vec{\alpha}_1$ and $\vec{\alpha}_2$, respectively. Then four solutions to the system are
$$\boldsymbol{x}=\plusmn \vec{\alpha}_1e^{\lambda_1 t}, \boldsymbol{x}=\plusmn \vec{\alpha}_2e^{\lambda_2 t}\tag{1}$$
How do the trajectories of these four solutions look?  

One eigenvalue $\lambda = 0$.  
A set of parallel lines.
